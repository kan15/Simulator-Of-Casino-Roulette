# Simple simulator of casino roulette. :moneybag::dollar::money_with_wings:

In this task I had to follow the following points to create a simple analog of roulette.

## Step 1:
-	Create a prompt window. Show the message inside the window ‘Do you want to play a game?’.
-	In case the user clicks the 'Cancel' button, the message 'You did not become a billionaire, but can.' should be shown.
## Step 2:
-	If user clicked ‘Ok’ – start a game: randomly choose an integer number in range [0; 8] (including 0 and 8)and ask user to enter a number of pocket on which the ball could land.
-	User has 3 attempts to guess a number.
-	If user guessed the numberon which ball landed, on 1-st attempt prize is 100$ (maximum prize for current numbers range), 2-nd attempt – 50$, 3-rd attempt – 25$. 
-	If user did not guess a number show the message ‘Thank you for your participation. Your prize is: … $’ (Use alert) and ask if he wants to play again.
## Step 3:
-	If user did guess - Show the message ‘Congratulation, you won!   Your prize is: … $. Do you want to continue?’.
-	If user does not want to continue – show the message ‘Thank you for your participation. Your prize is: … $’ (Use alert) and ask if he wants to play again.
-	If user does want to continue, make number range bigger at 4 as the previous one (for example [0; 8] -> [0; 12]), and two times bigger maximum prize (for example on 1-st attempt prize will be 200$, 2-nd attempt – 100$, 3-rd attempt – 50$). Prize must be added to the previous one and number of attempts should be set to 3 (user should have 3 attempts to guess a number for each numbers range)
-	Each time you ask user to enter a number you should show him a range of cells, how much attempts he has left, his total prize and possible prize on current attempt.
